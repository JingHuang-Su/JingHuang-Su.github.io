        <p>
          First of all, I not major in Computer Science, I received my <strong>BA of
          Finance degree</strong> from
          <a href="http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/chinese/">National Taipei University</a>, so why I want to learn programming
          and pursue a front-end developer as my career? 
          
          <p>During my time at
          university, I took a statistics course when I was a sophomore. this
          course have lots of homework that need to using R language to do with.
          however, I have no programming experience before, so I need to spend
          more time and effort to compelete every homework, because of this
          experience, <strong>I learned problem-solving skill</strong>.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, I started my journey in the programming world, but only
          watch some online tutorials, I don't get my hand dirty with
          programming in that time, until I found some good resourses on the
          internet, such as <a href="https://cs61a.org/fa18">CS61A</a>, <a href="https://sp19.datastructur.es/">CS61B</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/">NodeJS</a>,
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux">Modern React with Redux</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/">MERN Stack Front To Back</a>,
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/">Advanced CSS and Sass</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/advanced-javascript-concepts/">Advanced JavaScript Concept</a> and
          so on<sup>*</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Because we know that the best way to learn is learning by doing </strong> , I did
          almost all of labs and assignments from CS61A and CS61B, I also did
          some of personal projects with the knowledge I have gained from Udemy
          courses. you could check them on my <a href="https://github.com/JingHuang-Su">Github account</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This just beginning in my programming journey, I still need to
          compelete other fundamentals knowledge of computer science, such as
          <a>Operating System</a>, <a>Computer Architecture</a>,
          <a>Database Theory</a> and <a>renew my front-end knowledge</a>
